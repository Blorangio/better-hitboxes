# better-hitboxes
A function for creating better hitboxes. I plan on creating a JavaScript Web app where you can upload an image for a background and using a set of tools you can make a hitbox for that image. Then you can copy and paste a function for Java, C++, and Javascript that will output a boolean value and a integer based off the line that you hit. 
Here is the website:

A basic version has been set up where you can draw lines and move your mouse to collide with them but there are no curves yet and no code is printed to copy yet either.
