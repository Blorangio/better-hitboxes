# better-hitboxes
A function for creating better hitboxes. I plan on creating a Java app where you can upload an image for a background and using a set of tools you can make a hitbox for that image. Then you can copy and paste a function for Java, C++, and Javascript that will output a boolean value and a integer based off the line that you hit.
