# better-hitboxes
A function for creating better hitboxes. I plan on creating a JavaScript Web app where you can upload an image for a background and using a set of tools you can make a hitbox for that image. Then you can copy and paste a function for Java, C++, and Javascript that will output a boolean value and a integer based off the line that you hit. 
Here is the website:

A basic version has been set up where you can draw lines and move your mouse to collide with them but there are no curves yet and no code is printed to copy yet either.
As of now the project is not yet complete, there are still many bugs and you can't print your code yet. So far you can only draw lines by holding down the left mouse button and dragging, then click the side of the line that you want the line to check for. (it will make more sense if you try it). Then if you draw 2 lines a red dot will appear where there is a collision if there is a collision. The red dots will only appear though on the corners of the shape.
