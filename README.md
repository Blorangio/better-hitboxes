# better-hitboxes
A function for creating better hitboxes. I plan on creating a Java app where you can upload an image for a background and using a set of tools you can make a hitbox for that image. Then you can copy and paste a function for Java, C++, and Javascript that will output a boolean value and a integer based off the line that you hit.

This is also my first time doing a github project, so if anyone looking out at the program can share how to make it a file that can be run like an application, that would be greatly appreciated.
